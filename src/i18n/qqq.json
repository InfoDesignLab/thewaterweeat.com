  "Eating water might sound strange, but you are about to discover that actually you eat loads of it, you are addicted to it, <b>and you don’t know it.</b>": "",
  "An understanding of our water consumption can help us provide a solution to one of our most pressing problems:<br><b>making sure there is enough water for everybody on the planet.</b>": "",
  "<b>You</b> can be <b>part</b> of that": "",
  "solution": "",
  "Much of the water<br>we use is obvious<br>it's <b>visible</b> in our<br>homes.": "",
  "It's the water we<br>use at home for<br>drinking, cooking,<br>washing. That is<br>our <b>domestic<br>consumption.</b>": "",
  "Our <b>domestic<br>consumption</b> is<br><b>137 litres</b> of water<br>everyday.": "",
  "This is how we<br>manage those<br><b>137 litres</b>": "",

  "Bathing and Showering": "",
  "There is a little<br>problem though,<br>because what we<br>consume at home<br>is visible to us, but<br>it is <b>only a small</b><br>bit of what we use<br><b>in total.</b><br>There are two<br><b>invisible parts.</b>": "",
  "<b>The first invisible<br>part</b> is the water<br>used for the<br>production of the<br>industrial products<br>we consume<br>everyday, such as<br>paper, cotton, <br>clothes. This part<br>amounts to<br><b>167 litres per day.</b>": "",
  "<b>The second big<br>invisible part</b> is<br>associated with<br>the production of<br>the <b>food</b> we<br>consume.<br>This amounts to<br><b>3<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>496 litres per day</b><br>which means that<br><b>92%</b> of the water<br>we use is <b>invisible<br>and it is hidden in our food!</b>": "",
  "We call this invisible water <b>Virtual Water</b>, a term coined<br>by water guru Prof. Tony Allan. The concept of virtual water<br>helps us realize how much water is needed to produce the<br>goods we use and the food we eat.": "",
  "Let's discover why it is invisible.": "",
  "Consider <b>beef</b> for instance.": "",
  "In an industrial beef production<br>system it takes on<br>average <b>three years</b> before the animal is<br>slaughtered to<br>produce about<br><b>200 kilos</b> of<br>boneless beef.": "",
  "During the three<br>years the cow<br>consumes nearly<br><b>1<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>300 kg of grains</b><br>such as wheat,<br>oats, barley, corn,<br>dry peas, and other<br>small grains.": "",
  "The cow also<br>consumes <b>7<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>200 kg</b><br><b>of roughages</b> such<br>as pasture, dry<br>hay, silage, and<br>other roughages.": "",
  "The production of<br>all the grains and<br>roughages requires<br><b>3<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>060<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>000 litres of<br>water.</b>": "",
  "We need to take<br>into account also<br><b>24<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>000 litres</b> of<br>water that the cow drinks during the<br>three years": "",
  "and we do not<br>have to forget the<br><b>7<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>000 litres</b> for<br>servicing the<br>farmhouse and for<br>slaughtering<br>processes.": "",
  "Therefore, <b>in total</b>, we need <b>3<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>091<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>000 litres</b> of water<br>for producing <b>200 kilos</b> of boneless beef.<br>This means that to produce 1 kilogram of boneless beef<br><b>we need</b>": "",
  "Can you visualize 15<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>400 litres of water in your head?": "",
  "Well, if this is a <b>1 litre</b> water bottle,": "",
  "this is how 15<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>400 litres look like,<br>an 8 by 40 metre water-wall!": "",
  "$1 METRES": "",
  "Yes, an 8 by 40 metre water-wall!": "",
  "All completely hidden in a big steak!": "",
  "Water is precious. But not just for drinking: <b>water is food!</b><br>Thanks to the extraordinary work of scientists we know how<br>much water we need to produce the food we consume. It is<br>easy to see  that some products such as fruit and vegetables<br>are more water-friendly than others.": "",
  "So now we know:": "",
  "most of the water we use <b>- 92 % of it -</b> is used in food<br>production. Most of this water is managed by the world’s<br>farmers. With the help of science and technology they have<br>performed greater and greater miracles in improving water<br>productivity – in getting more crops per drop.": "",
  "Can we help?": "",
  "we can!": "",
  "The good news is that each one of us can also make the<br>world a little more water secure, ready to face the needs of<br>our peak population future. How?": "",
  "The answer lies in our shopping baskets.": "",
  "The amount of meat in our diet is crucial! The average daily water consumption of a meat-eating person is 5<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>000 litres of water per day. The average for a vegetarian is 2<span class=\"blank-point\"></span>500 litres. In countries where there is a culture of heavy meat consumption, the advice is: <b>one meat-free-day a week!</b> Every little bit helps.": "",
  "The type of meat we consume is crucial! <b>Choose meat raised on grass if you can</b>. It is normally a more sensible use of water resources, since the land often cannot be used for highly productive crop production. Meat from sheep almost always falls into this category. Agri-corporations and supermarkets do not generally fit the grass-fed livestock model. Cheap meat is usually fed on grain, corn-fed beef is the problem.": "",
  "The food we waste is crucial! We are highly wasteful, particularly in the industrialized nations. In the advanced economies we throw away approximately 30% of the food we purchase. Almost a third! And with it, all the water resources we use to produce that food. It would be wise to consider whether we should be producing and buying that food in the first place, <b>so please, do not waste!</b>": "",
  "So, do not forget:": "",
  "one meat-free-day a week": "",
  "choose meat raised on grass": "",
  "do not waste food": "",
  "Enjoy a water sensible diet.": "",
