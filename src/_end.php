      <p data-i18n>The amount of meat in our diet is crucial! The average daily water consumption of a meat-eating person is 5<span class="blank-point"></span>000 litres of water per day. The average for a vegetarian is 2<span class="blank-point"></span>500 litres. In countries where there is a culture of heavy meat consumption, the advice is: <b>one meat-free-day a week!</b> Every little bit helps.</p>

      <p data-i18n>The type of meat we consume is crucial! <b>Choose meat raised on grass if you can</b>. It is normally a more sensible use of water resources, since the land often cannot be used for highly productive crop production. Meat from sheep almost always falls into this category. Agri-corporations and supermarkets do not generally fit the grass-fed livestock model. Cheap meat is usually fed on grain, corn-fed beef is the problem.</p>

      <p data-i18n>The food we waste is crucial! We are highly wasteful, particularly in the industrialized nations. In the advanced economies we throw away approximately 30% of the food we purchase. Almost a third! And with it, all the water resources we use to produce that food. It would be wise to consider whether we should be producing and buying that food in the first place, <b>so please, do not waste!</b></p>
